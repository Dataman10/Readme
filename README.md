## 👋 Overview

I am a **final-year B.E. student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** with a strong focus on **data analytics, machine learning, and production-ready ML solutions**. I work on transforming raw, unstructured data into **actionable insights** and deploy models that align with **real-world business and financial use cases**.

My interests lie at the intersection of **analytics, risk modeling, and scalable data systems**, where data quality, feature consistency, and interpretability are as important as model performance. I emphasize **clean data pipelines, structured analysis, and practical deployment** over purely experimental work.
